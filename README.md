# 8-bComputer
8 bit Computer design based on Ben Eater's 8 Bit Computer Youtube series. Hardware implementation of the design, KiCad schematics and Verilog implementation.

The project consists of three parts:
- Hardware implementation of an 8 bit computer using TTL chips and breadboards following Ben Eater's design.
- Schematics and documentation for the hardware design in KiCad.
- FPGA implementation in an Altera DE2-115 using Verilog and Quartus.
